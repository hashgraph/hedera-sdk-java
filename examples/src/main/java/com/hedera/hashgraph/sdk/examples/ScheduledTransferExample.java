/**
 * How to schedule a transfer transaction.
 * <p>
 * A scheduled transaction is a transaction that has been proposed by an account,
 * but which requires more signatures before it will actually execute on the Hedera network.
 * <p>
 * For example, if Alice wants to transfer an amount of Hbar to Bob, and Bob has
 * `receiverSignatureRequired` set to true, then that transaction must be signed by
 * both Alice and Bob before the transaction will be executed.
 * <p>
 * To solve this problem, Alice can propose the transaction by creating a scheduled
 * transaction on the Hedera network which, if executed, would transfer Hbar from
 * Alice to Bob. That scheduled transaction will have a `ScheduleId` by which we can
 * refer to that scheduled transaction. Alice can communicate the `ScheduleId` to Bob, and
 * then Bob can use a `ScheduleSignTransaction` to sign that scheduled transaction.
 * <p>
 * Bob has a 30-minute window in which to sign the scheduled transaction, starting at the
 * moment that Alice creates the scheduled transaction.  If a scheduled transaction
 * is not signed by all the necessary signatories within the 30-minute window,
 * that scheduled transaction will expire, and will not be executed.
 * <p>
 * Once a scheduled transaction has all the signatures necessary to execute, it will
 * be executed on the Hedera network automatically. If you create a scheduled transaction
 * on the Hedera network, but that transaction only requires your signature in order to
 * execute and no one else's, that scheduled transaction will be automatically
 * executed immediately.
