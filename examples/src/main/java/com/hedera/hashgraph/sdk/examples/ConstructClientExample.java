/**
 * How to construct and configure a client in different ways.
 * <p>
 * A client has a network and an operator.
 * <p>
 * A Hedera network is made up of nodes -- individual servers who participate
 * in the process of reaching consensus on the order and validity of transactions
 * on the network. Three networks you likely know of are previewnet, testnet, and mainnet.
 * <p>
 * For the purpose of connecting to it, each node has an IP address or URL and a port number.
 * Each node also has an AccountId used to refer to that node for several purposes,
 * including the paying of fees to that node when a client submits requests to it.
 * <p>
 * You can configure what network you want a client to use -- in other words, you can specify
 * a list of URLs and port numbers with associated account IDs, and
 * when that client is used to execute queries and transactions, the client will
 * submit requests only to nodes in that list.
 * <p>
 * A Client has an operator, which has an AccountId and a PublicKey, and which can
 * sign requests. A client's operator can also be configured.
