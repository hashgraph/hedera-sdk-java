         * A scheduled transaction is a transaction that has been proposed by an account,
         * but which requires more signatures before it will actually execute on the Hedera network.
         *
         * For example, if Alice wants to transfer an amount of Hbar to Bob, and Bob has
         * receiverSignatureRequired set to true, then that transaction must be signed by
         * both Alice and Bob before the transaction will be executed.
         *
         * To solve this problem, Alice can propose the transaction by creating a scheduled
         * transaction on the Hedera network which, if executed, would transfer Hbar from
         * Alice to Bob.  That scheduled transaction will have a ScheduleId by which we can
         * refer to that scheduled transaction.  Alice can communicate the ScheduleId to Bob, and
         * then Bob can use a ScheduleSignTransaction to sign that scheduled transaction.
         *
         * Bob has a 30 minute window in which to sign the scheduled transaction, starting at the
         * moment that Alice creates the scheduled transaction.  If a scheduled transaction
         * is not signed by all of the necessary signatories within the 30 minute window,
         * that scheduled transaction will expire, and will not be executed.
         *
         * Once a scheduled transaction has all of the signatures necessary to execute, it will
         * be executed on the Hedera network automatically.  If you create a scheduled transaction
         * on the Hedera network, but that transaction only requires your signature in order to
         * execute and no one else's, that scheduled transaction will be automatically
         * executed immediately.
