         * Here are some ways you can construct and configure a client.
         * A client has a network and an operator.
         *
         * A Hedera network is made up of nodes -- individual servers who participate
         * in the process of reaching consensus on the order and validity of transactions
         * on the network.  Three networks you likely know of are previewnet, testnet, and mainnet.
         *
         * For the purpose of connecting to it, each node has an IP address or URL and a port number.
         * Each node also has an AccountId used to refer to that node for several purposes,
         * including the paying of fees to that node when a client submits requests to it.
         *
         * You can configure what network you want a client to use -- in other words, you can specify
         * a list of URLS and port numbers with associated AccountIds, and
         * when that client is used to execute queries and transactions, the client will
         * submit requests only to nodes in that list.
         *
         * A Client has an operator, which has an AccountId and a PublicKey, and which can
         * sign requests.  A client's operator can also be configured.

        // Here's the simplest way to construct a client:

        // These clients' networks are filled with default lists of nodes that are baked into the SDK.
        // Their operators are not yet set, and trying to use them now will result in exceptions.

        // We can also construct a client for previewnet, testnet, or mainnet depending on the value of a
        // network name string.  If, for example, the input string equals "testnet", this client will be
        // configured to connect to testnet.
        Client namedNetworkClient = Client.forName(HEDERA_NETWORK);

        // Let's set the operator on testClient.

        // in the form of a list of nodes.

        // using fromConfigFile() immediately.
