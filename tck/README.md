# Java SDK TCK Server

## Description
This module contains implementation of the JSON-RPC server for the Java SDK to interpret and process requests from the Test Driver based on the [TCK's](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-tck/) requirements. Upon receiving a request, it executes the corresponding function or procedure associated with the method specified in the request. Subsequently, it prepares the response in JSON format and sends it back to the test driver.

## Setup
**1. Navigate into tck directory.**
```shell
cd tck
```
**2. Build the project using Gradle.**
```shell
./gradlew build
```
**3. Run the server.**
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

By default, the server will occupy port 80. If you need to specify a different port, modify the port in the `application.yml` file:
``` yaml
server:
    port: <PORT>
```
