/* Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.

  Everything is partitioned into realms so that each Solidity smart contract can  access everything in just a single realm, locking all those entities while it's  running, but other smart contracts could potentially run in other realms in  parallel. So realms allow Solidity to be parallelized somewhat, even though the  language itself assumes everything is serial. */

A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow.

/* A Key can be a public key from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. And similarly for RSA and ECDSA.
 *
 * A Key can be a smart contract ID, which means that smart contract is to authorize operations as if it had signed with a key that it owned. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key.
 *
 * A key can be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements.
 *
 * A Key can be a list of keys. Their use is dependent on context. For example, a Hedera file is created with a list of keys, where all of them must sign a transaction to create or modify the file, but only one of them is needed to sign a transaction to delete the file. So it's a single list that sometimes acts as a 1-of-M threshold key, and sometimes acts as an M-of-M threshold key.
 *
 * A Key can contain a ThresholdKey or KeyList, which in turn contain a Key, so this mutual recursion would allow nesting arbitrarily deep. The current API only allows the nesting to a depth of 3 levels, such as the key being a list of threshold keys, each of which contains a list of primitive keys (e.g., ed25519). In the future, this requirement may be relaxed, to allow deeper nesting.

A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API).

That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.

But the current API only accepts Key messages up to 3 levels deep, such as a list of threshold keys, each of which is a list of primitive keys. Therefore, the matching Signature will have the same limitation. This restriction may be relaxed in future versions of the API, to allow deeper nesting.
